Steps involved:

1. Empathize: For understanding the experiences and pain points of visually challenged individuals using mobile payment applications in outdoor and indoor settings, we conducted user research using qualitative interviews on zoom calls and also carried auto-ethnography as one of the team members was visually challenged. We then transcribed the interviews; developed themes from coding and axial coding: and made personas, scenarios, and storyboards to highlight the key findings from the user study.

2. Define: We then defined a problem statement keeping in mind the major issues faced by the user that included a cluttered interface, unlabelled buttons, and a small-time window. Our Problem statement: 'How to improve the user experience of the mobile payment application for the visually challenged individuals while they are

performing peer-to-peer transaction?' 3. Ideate: For ideation, we used participatory design methodology: inspiration card workshop'. 4. Prototype: We developed a low fidelity prototype (Braille inscribed on cardboard simulating mobile phone screens) and a high fidelity prototype (by deploying Adobe XD) for usability testing.

5. Test: For evaluating the prototype, one of us (team members) enacted the screen reader's voice while testing the low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototype with the participants. The methods used for evaluation plan :

- Hawk evaluation

- Speak aloud for low fidelity prototype with Visually challenged users, followed by an interview

- Speak aloud for high fidelity prototype with Visually sighted users, followed by an interview
