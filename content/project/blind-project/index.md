The usage of mobile payment apps over a period of time has seen staggering growth, mainly because they allow for a seamless and relatively low cost of funds. People are using mobile payment apps for a variety of purposes from phone recharge, bill payments, shopping to flight bookings. This has allowed various mobile payment service providers to tap into the mobile payment market for cashing on its unparalleled advantages. Though there are numerous benefits of using these mobile payment apps, still the transition from a cash to a completely digitized payment landscape would take time. Thus, it becomes important to investigate how different people perceive these mobile payment apps, including the visually challenged one. Through this research we tried to understand the pain points and frustrations of visually challenged individual who are using mobile payment applications;their reasons for adoption and deterrents for non-adoption and ultimately we tried to design prototype of the payment interface which would be accessible for them.
