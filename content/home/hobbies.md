I am dedicated to promoting the rich heritage of authentic Indian vegetarian cuisine globally through my Instagram page. The page has over 18000 followers. 

**Motivation to start the page**: The trend of getting fit is on the rise. However, the importance of traditional Indian cuisine in upholding a healthy lifestyle is underappreciated. There is a need for Indians to embrace their own diverse food heritage and look at their traditional food wisdom as healthy. My Instagram channel is an effort in the same direction where I showcase authentic Indian foods that are healthy, easily available, affordable, and also suit Indian taste buds.

The page also helps me to express my creativity as I do the photoshoot of all the cuisines that I prepare. Attached are the images of few of my culinary preparation.

Additionally, as a personal pursuit, I play guitar for relaxation and enjoyment.
