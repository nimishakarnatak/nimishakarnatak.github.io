My research is motivated by the fundamental need to address the inequalities faced by underserved populations with the mission of improving their quality of life. In pursuit of this mission, I joined the [Technology and Empowerment Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-and-empowerment/) at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) as a [Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/), where I conduct human-centered research in the domain of Healthcare under the supervision of [Dr. Bill Theis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Thies), [Dr. Mohit Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mohja/), and [Dr. Indrani Medhi Theis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/indranim/). My work at MSRI has given me the opportunity to closely examine the intricate technology usage and interactions of multiple stakeholder within the healthcare ecosystem, including patients, healthcare professionals, and community health workers. With a passion for empowering individuals and breaking down technological barriers, my Master's degree research has been dedicated to promoting accessibility and inclusiveness in both technological spaces and solutions. The overarching aim of my research is to contribute to the democratization of technology, particularly in the realm of wellness technologies. Through a collaborative and user-centered approach, I strive to create inclusive solutions that address the needs and enhance the wellbeing of underrepresented and underserved communities.
