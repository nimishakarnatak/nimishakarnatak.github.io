I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research Lab, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) working under the guidance of [Dr. Mohit Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mohja/), and [Dr. Bill Theis](https://billthies.net/). My research interests lie at the intersection of technology and healthcare. I am also interested in the field of Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D). A significant portion of my current research work revolves around understanding the digital healthcare ecosystem in low resource communities in India.

I received my Master's of Science in Digital Design from [IIIT, Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/) where I was part of the Dean's Merit List. Before that, I completed my B.Tech. in Industrial and Production Engineering from [G.B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar](https://www.gbpuat.ac.in/) where I was the Vice Chancellor's Silver Medalist and recieved topper's scholarship throught the B.Tech programme.
