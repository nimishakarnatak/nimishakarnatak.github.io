Hi, I am Nimisha Karnatak, and I am working at [Microsoft Research Lab, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) as a [Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/). Within MSRI, I conduct human-centered research in the domain of Healthcare, and I am advised by [Dr. Bill Theis](https://billthies.net/), [Dr. Mohit Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mohja/), and [Dr. Indrani Medhi Theis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/indranim/). During my tenure at MSRI, I have examined the technology usage and interactions of multiple stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem, like patients, healthcare professionals, and community health workers. During my M.Sc., I have worked towards making technologies and spaces accessible and inclusive for people with visual impairments and older adults, respectively. The overarching aim of my research is to contribute to the democratization of technology, with a focus on wellness technologies (that encompass both healthcare and accessibility-related technologies) by co-designing inclusive solutions tailored to underrepresented and underserved communities.
