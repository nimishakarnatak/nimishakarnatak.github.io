I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), where I am supervised by [Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Shadbolt) and [Professor Max Van Kleek](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/max.vankleek/) (two of my favorite people in the world!). My PhD research focuses on the inclusive development of LLM-based systems for novice technology users in high-stakes settings. Alongside my doctoral studies, I am also working as an International Consultant at <img style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" src="https://brandlogos.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/World-Bank-logo-icon-512x512.png" alt= “” width="20" height="20"> [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/what-we-do). Prior to this, I also worked as Student Researcher at <img style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@lobehub/icons-static-png/latest/files/dark/deepmind-color.png" alt= “” width="20" height="20">  [<span style="color: #4285F4;">G</span><span style="color: #EA4335;">o</span><span style="color: #FBBC05;">o</span><span style="color: #4285F4;">g</span><span style="color: #34A853;">l</span><span style="color: #EA4335;">e</span> DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) in London, where my research focuses on co-creation with generative AI.

Before joining PhD, I worked as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/) at <img style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Microsoft_logo.svg" alt= “” width="20" height="20"> [Microsoft Research India (MSRI)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/). At MSRI, I conducted human-centered research in the domain of healthcare under the supervision of (the incredible) [Dr. Bill Theis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Thies). Over the years, I have been privileged to contribute as an intern or research assistant at some of the world's most prestigious institutions, including the [International Labour Organization (𝐈𝐋𝐎)](https://www.ilo.org/) in Geneva, Switzerland, the [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (𝐈𝐈𝐓-𝐑)](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), the [Indian School of Business (𝐈𝐒𝐁)](https://www.isb.edu/en.html), and the [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (𝐈𝐈𝐑𝐒)](https://www.iirs.gov.in/) under the [Indian Space Research Organization (𝐈𝐒𝐑𝐎)](https://www.isro.gov.in/).
