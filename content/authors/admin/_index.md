Hi,I am Nimisha Karnatak, and I am working at [Microsoft Research Lab, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) as a [Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow]https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/). Within MSRI, I conduct human-centered research in the domain of Healthcare, and I am advised by [Dr. Bill Theis](https://billthies.net/), [Dr. Mohit Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mohja/), and [Dr. Indrani Medhi Theis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/indranim/). During my tenure at MSRI, I have examined the technology usage and interactions of multiple stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem, like patients, healthcare professionals, and community health workers. During my M.Sc., I have worked towards making technologies and spaces accessible and inclusive for people with visual impairments and older adults, respectively. The broader goal of my research is to democratize technologies, particularly wellness technologies* (including healthcare and accessibility technologies) by co-designing inclusive solutions tailored to underrepresented and underserved communities. 

I earned my Master of Science in Digital Society (specialization: Data Intensive Digital Design) from [International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/) where I was recognized for my academic achievements as part of the Dean's Merit List. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor of Technology in Industrial and Production Engineering from [G.B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar](https://www.gbpuat.ac.in/), where I was awarded the Vice Chancellor's Silver Medal and received the Topper’s Merit scholarship throughout the B.Tech program.
